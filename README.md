# Counting Coventry

Welcome to Counting Coventry.

Footfall counting, that is, counting the number of people visiting an event, activity, or venue provides a way in which operators and funders to understand the popularity of an event, activity, or venue.  
Counting people helps us understand footfall traffic patterns across the city centre, enabling us to:
*	put together funding bids to attract businesses and retailers to the city centre; 
*	improve public transport and green travel provision;
*	understand the impact of our programme of investments and public arts in the city.
